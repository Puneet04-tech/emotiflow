# ⚡ Quick Fix: Reload EmotiFlow (Background Worker Error Fixed)

## 🔴 Error You Saw
```
ReferenceError: window is not defined
(in Service Worker console)
```

## ✅ We Fixed It!

### What Was Wrong:
- Background service worker tried to access `window` object
- Service workers don't have `window` (they're "headless")
- This only works in content scripts and popups

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Fixed `src/background/aiEngine.ts` - removed window.ai access
2. ✅ Fixed `src/background/index.ts` - changed window.setInterval() to setInterval()
3. ✅ Fixed `src/utils/aiPrompts.ts` - added safe window check
4. ✅ Rebuilt extension successfully
