## Why This Fix Works

**Old Way (❌ Broken):**
```html
<style>body { background: blue; }</style>
<script>btn.addEventListener('click', () => {});</script>
```
→ CSP blocks inline code!

**New Way (✅ Fixed):**
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
<script src="popup.js"></script>
```
→ CSP allows external files!

- ✅ External JS file (popup.js)
- ✅ Clean HTML file (index.html)
