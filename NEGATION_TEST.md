## üéØ Success Criteria

‚úÖ **You've Passed If:**

1. **Type "i am not angry"** ‚Üí Shows **calm** (NOT frustrated or angry)
2. **Console shows** `‚ö†Ô∏è  Negation detected` message
3. **Sidepanel shows** calm emotion
4. **Type "i am angry"** (without "not") ‚Üí Shows **angry** (NORMAL, no negation)
5. **Console shows** NO negation message for normal anger
6. **Other emotions still work** (happy, sad, excited)

## üî¥ If Still Broken

### Console shows wrong emotion despite negation message

**Possible causes:**
1. Extension not properly reloaded
   - Try: Disable extension ‚Üí Enable ‚Üí Reload page

2. Advanced NLP might need fine-tuning
   - Advanced NLP handles negation but might not detect it perfectly
   - This is normal - it's better but not 100%

3. Cache issue
   - Clear cache: Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Chrome settings)
   - Close all Chrome windows and reopen

### Console shows no negation message

**Check:**
1. Is negation word spelled correctly?
   - Works: "not", "no", "never", "don't", "can't", "isn't"
   - Doesn't work: "didn'nt" (typo)

2. Is negation too far before keyword?
   - Checks 5 words before keyword
   - "i was very angry but not really angry" might not work

3. Is keyword being found at all?
   - Check: "angry" is in the keyword list
   - Try simpler: "i am not happy"

```javascript
// Find the search box
const searchBox = document.querySelector('input[title="Search"]');
if (searchBox) {
  // Set text
  searchBox.value = 'i am not angry';
  // Trigger input event
  searchBox.dispatchEvent(new Event('input', { bubbles: true }));
