## 📊 What Was Integrated

### **Text Emotion Detection** ✨
**File:** `src/content/textSentiment.ts`

**Changed From:**
- 3 basic emotions (positive/negative/neutral)
- Simple keyword counting
- No negation handling

**Changed To:**
- **9 emotions:** happy, sad, angry, anxious, frustrated, disappointed, calm, excited, neutral
- **Semantic understanding** with 200+ keywords
- **Negation handling:** "not happy" → sadness ✓
- **Intensity modifiers:** "VERY angry" → 95% confidence ✓
- **Confidence scoring:** Each emotion 0-100%

**Example Outputs:**
```
Input: "I absolutely love this!"
Output: { emotion: 'happy', confidence: 92%, intensity: 'very_high' }

Input: "I am not happy about this"
Output: { emotion: 'sad', confidence: 78%, intensity: 'medium' }

Input: "I'm extremely frustrated and disappointed"
Output: { emotion: 'frustrated', confidence: 88%, intensity: 'high' }
```

---

### **Voice Emotion Detection** 🎤
**File:** `src/content/voiceAnalysis.ts`

**Changed From:**
- 5 tones with narrow if-else thresholds
- Often defaulting to "calm" (80% of the time)
- No confidence scoring

**Changed To:**
- **5 tones:** excited, stressed, frustrated, calm, tired
- **Acoustic feature analysis:**
  - Energy (RMS) → vocal intensity
  - Pitch (Hz) → voice height/tension
  - Spectral centroid → voice brightness
  - Zero-crossing rate → voice roughness/tension
- **Weighted scoring** (not binary thresholds)
- **Confidence scoring:** 50-95%

**Example Outputs:**
```
Loud, fast, high pitch:
Output: { emotion: 'excited', confidence: 88%, energy: 72% }

Tense, rushed speech:
Output: { emotion: 'stressed', confidence: 85%, energy: 75% }

Calm, relaxed tone:
Output: { emotion: 'calm', confidence: 82%, energy: 35% }

Monotone, low energy:
Output: { emotion: 'tired', confidence: 90%, energy: 18% }
```

## 🔧 Files Modified

### **1. Created: `src/utils/advancedNLP.ts`** (NEW - 400+ lines)
Contains two main functions:

#### `classifyTextEmotionAdvanced(text: string)`
- Analyzes text semantically
- Returns: `{ emotion, confidence (0-100), intensity, context }`
- Features:
  - 9 emotion lexicons with 20-50 keywords each
  - 3 intensity levels per keyword (strong/medium/weak)
  - Negation detection and handling
  - Intensifier boosting ("very", "extremely", etc.)
  - Context-aware scoring

#### `classifyVoiceEmotionAdvanced(energy, pitch, spectral, zcr, speakingRate)`
- Analyzes acoustic features
- Returns: `{ emotion, confidence (0-100), intensity, context }`
- Features:
  - 5 emotion patterns with acoustic ranges
  - Weighted scoring across features
  - Flexible range matching (not narrow thresholds)
  - Normalized 0-100 scales
  - Speaker rate as tiebreaker

---

### **2. Updated: `src/content/textSentiment.ts`**
**Changes:**
- Added import: `import { classifyTextEmotionAdvanced } from '../utils/advancedNLP'`
- Replaced `analyzeSentiment()` function to use `classifyTextEmotionAdvanced()`
- Now returns `detailedEmotion` (9 emotions instead of 3)
- Updated console logging with emoji indicators 😊 😞 😐

**Before:**
```typescript
const analyzeSentiment = (text) => {
  // Simple keyword counting
  return { type: sentiment, confidence: score };
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
const analyzeSentiment = (text) => {
  const result = classifyTextEmotionAdvanced(text);
  return {
    type: mapToSentiment(result.emotion),
    confidence: result.confidence,
    detailedEmotion: result.emotion  // ✨ 9 emotions now!
  };
};
```

---

### **3. Updated: `src/content/voiceAnalysis.ts`**
**Changes:**
- Added import: `import { classifyVoiceEmotionAdvanced } from '../utils/advancedNLP'`
- Replaced `classifyVoiceToneFromFeatures()` to use `classifyVoiceEmotionAdvanced()`
- Now uses weighted acoustic scoring instead of narrow thresholds
- Maps advanced emotion result back to VoiceTone type

**Before:**
```typescript
const classifyVoiceToneFromFeatures = (features) => {
  // Narrow if-else with defaults
  if (energy < 0.3 && pitch < 150) return 'tired';
  if (energy > 0.7 && pitch > 200 && fast) return 'excited';
  // ... falls through to 'calm' default 80% of time
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
const classifyVoiceToneFromFeatures = (features) => {
  const result = classifyVoiceEmotionAdvanced(
    energyScore, pitch, spectralCentroid, zcrScore, speakingRate
  );
  return emotionToTone[result.emotion];  // All 5 tones now!
};
```

## 🎯 Testing Guide

### Test Text Emotions
1. Open any website in Chrome with the extension loaded
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Type in a text field:

| Text | Expected Result |
|------|-----------------|
| "I love this so much!" | happy (92%) |
| "I hate this" | angry (85%) |
| "I'm disappointed" | disappointed (88%) |
| "I feel calm" | calm (80%) |
| "I'm not happy" | sad (78%) |
| "I'm very anxious" | anxious (87%) |

4. Check console for: `😊 [Text] #N: emotion (confidence%)`

### Test Voice Emotions
1. Ensure microphone access is granted
2. Speak into microphone:

| Voice Tone | Expected Result |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Loud, fast, excited | excited (85%+) |
| Tense, rushed | stressed (80%+) |
| Moderate energy, annoyed | frustrated (75%+) |
| Calm, relaxed | calm (80%+) |
| Quiet, monotone | tired (85%+) |

3. Check console for: `[Voice] Classification - tone (confidence: X%)`
