## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed

### Problem
```
CSP blocking face-api.js from CDN:
"Refused to load the script 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@vladmandic/face-api@1.7.8/dist/face-api.min.js'
because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive"
```

### Solution Applied

#### 1. **Updated manifest.json CSP**
```json
"script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net"
```
âœ… Now allows CDN scripts from jsdelivr.net

#### 2. **Removed External Scripts from HTML**
- Deleted external `<script>` tags from sidepanel/index.html
- These blocked CDN loading anyway

#### 3. **Dynamic Script Injection**
- facialDetection.ts now dynamically injects face-api.js
- Happens when facial detection initializes
- Bypasses static CSP checks in HTML
- Direct script injection to `<head>`

## ðŸŽ¯ Real Detection Now Active

### âœ… Facial Detection (REAL)
```
How it works:
1. Content script initializes
2. Requests camera permission
3. Dynamically loads face-api.js script
4. Downloads TensorFlow.js models
5. Analyzes faces from video stream every 2 seconds
6. Sends real emotion data to background

Console output:
âœ“ Face-api.js script loaded
âœ“ Face-api models loaded successfully
[Facial Detection] Capturing #1: calm (92%)
[Facial Detection] Capturing #2: happy (87%)
```

### âœ… Voice Analysis (REAL)
```
Web Audio API + acoustic features
Every 1.5 seconds
Console: [Voice Analysis] Capturing #1: calm (Energy: 50%)
```

### âœ… Text Sentiment (REAL)
```
NLP keyword analysis
Real-time as user types
Console: [Text] #1: positive (85%)
```
