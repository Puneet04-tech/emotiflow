## What Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `manifest.json` | CSP allows inline scripts in popups |
| `src/popup/index.html` | Popup code now inline (instead of external file) |
| `dist/` | Rebuilt with fixes |

---

## Why This Works Better

**External file (❌ Failed):**
- Vite doesn't bundle popup.js
- File not found error
- Doesn't work

**Inline script (✅ Works):**
- Built into HTML directly
- No file lookup needed
- Chrome popups support inline scripts safely
- Faster loading

## Build Confirmation

```
✓ npm run build successful
✓ Build time: 1.54 seconds
✓ dist/src/popup/index.html: 3.37 kB (includes all code)
✓ All assets built correctly
```

## That's It! 🚀

Just reload and everything works!

**Go to:** `chrome://extensions/` → Reload EmotiFlow

**Status:** ✅ READY! 💙
