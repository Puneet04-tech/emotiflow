# 🎯 Enhanced Emotion Keyword Detection - Tuned & Prioritized

## ✅ What Changed

Updated `src/content/textSentiment.ts` with a **priority-based strong keyword system**. Each emotion now has:
- **Multiple keywords** (not just 1-2)
- **Individual confidence levels** (not all 90%)
- **Priority ranking** (checked in order)

## 🔍 How It Works

### Matching Logic:
1. **Extract last sentence** from text (split on `.`, `!`, `?`, or newline)
2. **Check emotions by priority** (highest priority first)
3. **Within each emotion, check all keywords** (word boundary match, case-insensitive)
4. **Stop at first match** - return that emotion with its confidence level
5. **If no keyword match** - fall back to `classifyTextEmotionAdvanced()` (advanced NLP)

### Priority Order Explained:
- **Angry (10)**: Strongest negative emotion, checked first
- **Frustrated (9)**: Strong negative, lower than angry
- **Anxious (8)**: Fear-based negative
- **Sad (7)**: Melancholic negative
- **Disappointed (6)**: Mild negative
- **Happy (5)**: Strong positive
- **Excited (4)**: High-energy positive
- **Calm (3)**: Neutral/positive
- **Tired (2)**: Low-energy neutral

### Confidence Levels:
- **95%** - Angry (most decisive)
- **93%** - Happy (very clear)
- **92%** - Sad (very clear)
- **91%** - Excited (very clear)
- **90%** - Anxious (very clear)
- **88%** - Frustrated (clear)
- **87%** - Calm (clear)
- **86%** - Tired (clear)
- **85%** - Disappointed (reasonably clear)

## 🧪 Test Cases

### Test 1: Single Keyword (Your Example)
```
Type: "i am angry"
Expected: 95% angry (matches high-priority keyword)
Console: 😠 [Text] #1: angry (95%)
UI: Shows 'frustrated' (angry maps to frustrated in primary emotions)
```

### Test 2: Multiple Keywords (Picks First by Priority)
```
Type: "i am angry and frustrated"
Expected: 95% angry (angry has priority 10, frustration has priority 9)
Console: 😠 [Text] #2: angry (95%)
```

### Test 3: Lower Priority Emotion
```
Type: "i feel so disappointed"
Expected: 85% disappointed (lower confidence than angry)
Console: 😢 [Text] #3: disappointed (85%)
UI: Shows 'sad' (disappointed maps to sad)
```

### Test 4: Positive Emotions
```
Type: "i love this so much"
Expected: 93% happy (love keyword detected)
Console: 😊 [Text] #4: happy (93%)
UI: Shows 'happy'
```

### Test 5: No Strong Keyword Match
```
Type: "i feel pretty good about things"
Expected: Falls back to classifyTextEmotionAdvanced()
Confidence: Whatever advanced NLP returns (e.g., 75%)
Console: 😊 [Text] #5: happy (75%)
```

### Test 6: Negation Still Works (Via Advanced NLP)
```
Type: "i am not happy"
Expected: No immediate keyword match (because "happy" is there but negated)
Falls back to classifyTextEmotionAdvanced() which handles negation
Expected: ~78% sad (negation detected)
```

## 📝 How to Customize Further

To adjust the keyword list, edit the `emotionKeywordMap` in `src/content/textSentiment.ts`:

```typescript
const emotionKeywordMap: Record<string, { keywords: string[]; confidence: number; priority: number }> = {
  // Add new emotion:
  stressed: {
    keywords: ['stressed', 'tense', 'overwhelmed', 'pressure'],
    confidence: 92,
    priority: 8, // Insert between anxious (8) and sad (7)
  },
  
  // Modify existing:
  angry: {
    keywords: ['angry', 'furious', 'rage', 'livid', 'enraged', 'hate', 'hateful', 'disgusted', 'pissed'], // Add new keyword
    confidence: 95, // Adjust confidence
    priority: 10,
  },
};
```

**Then rebuild:**
```bash
npm run build
```

## ✨ Real-Time Behavior

### Scenario: You Type Multiple Sentences

```
User types:    "i am angry"
UI updates to: 😠 Frustrated (95% confidence)
Console logs:  😠 [Text] #1: angry (95%)

User appends:  ". then i calm down"
UI updates to: 😌 Calm (87% confidence)
Console logs:  😌 [Text] #2: calm (87%)

User appends:  ". but now disappointed"
UI updates to: 😢 Sad (85% confidence)
Console logs:  😢 [Text] #3: disappointed (85%)
```

Each sentence change triggers immediate detection and UI update.
