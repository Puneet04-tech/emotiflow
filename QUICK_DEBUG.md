## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### Problem 1: Console Completely Empty
**No messages at all when typing**

**Fix:**
1. Go to `chrome://extensions` ‚Üí EmotiFlow ‚Üí Click **Refresh**
2. Reload page: `Ctrl+R`
3. Try typing in a different text field
4. Try a different website

### Problem 2: Only Shows Initialization
**Shows init messages but nothing when you type**

```
[Text] ‚úì Text sentiment initialized - listeners attached
(then nothing happens when you type)
```

**Fix:**
1. Make sure you're clicking on an actual text input/textarea
2. Try Gmail compose box
3. Try Google search box
4. Type a complete sentence, not just one word
5. End with: `.` or `!` or `?` or press Enter

### Problem 3: Shows Input but No Emotion
**Shows input detected but not emotion**

```
[Text] Input event triggered
[Text] Input detected: "i love this"
(then stops - no emotion shown)
```

**Fix:**
1. Check browser console for any errors (red text)
2. Check sidepanel is open (right-click extension ‚Üí "Show sidepanel")
3. Reload extension completely: `chrome://extensions` ‚Üí Disable ‚Üí Enable ‚Üí Refresh

### Problem 4: Wrong Emotion Detected
**Console shows emotion but it's wrong**

```
[Text] ‚úì EMOTION_STATE_UPDATE: sad (80%)
(but expected: happy)
```

**Check:**
1. Do you have a negation word? "i am not happy" ‚Üí correctly shows sad
2. Did you use the right keyword? "happy" vs "happiness"
3. Advanced NLP might interpret differently

## üîß Manual Test in Console

If you want to trigger text analysis manually, paste this in DevTools Console:

```javascript
// Create test input
const input = document.querySelector('textarea') || document.querySelector('input[type="text"]');
if (input) {
  input.value = 'i love this';
  input.dispatchEvent(new Event('input', { bubbles: true }));
} else {
  console.log('No textarea found, create one manually');
}
```

Then watch console for emotion messages.
