## ðŸ”„ Changes Made

### 1. Facial Detection (`src/content/facialDetection.ts`)
âœ… **REAL**: face-api.js + Camera
- Load models from CDN
- Real camera stream processing
- 7 emotions detected (neutral, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgusted, surprised)
- Real confidence 0-100%
- Updates every 2 seconds
- Console: `[Facial Detection] Capturing #N: emotion (confidence%)`

### 2. Voice Analysis (`src/content/voiceAnalysis.ts`)
âœ… **REAL**: Web Audio API + Microphone
- Real audio stream capture
- 4 acoustic features (pitch, energy, spectral centroid, ZCR)
- 5 tone emotions (calm, tired, excited, stressed, frustrated)
- Real feature extraction from speech
- Updates every 1.5 seconds
- Console: `[Voice Analysis] Capturing #N: tone (Energy: X%, Pitch: YHz)`

### 3. Text Sentiment (`src/content/textSentiment.ts`)
âœ… **REAL**: NLP + Keyword Analysis
- 60+ emotional words in lexicon
- Real sentiment classification
- Context detection (search, email, comment, message)
- Real-time analysis as user types
- Console: `[Text] #N: sentiment (confidence%) - context`

### 4. Background Worker (`src/background/index.ts`)
âœ… **REMOVED MOCK DATA**
- Deleted `startMockEmotionGeneration()` function
- No more fake data every 5 seconds
- Now processes ONLY real data from content scripts
- Fuses real facial, voice, text into final emotion

### 5. HTML (`src/sidepanel/index.html`)
âœ… **ADDED FACE-API.JS**
- Added CDN script for face-api.js
- Loads TensorFlow.js models on demand

## ðŸš€ HOW TO TEST

### Test 1: Text Sentiment
```
â†’ Go to google.com
â†’ Type: "I hate this"
â†’ Expected: Negative emotion appears
â†’ Console: [Text] #1: negative (92%)
```

### Test 2: Voice
```
â†’ Grant microphone permission
â†’ Speak loudly
â†’ Expected: Excited emotion appears
â†’ Console: [Voice] #1: excited (78%)
```

### Test 3: Facial
```
â†’ Grant camera permission
â†’ Smile at camera
â†’ Expected: Happy emotion appears
â†’ Console: [Facial] #1: happy (92%)
```

### Test 4: Multiple Modalities
```
â†’ On google.com with camera + mic + typing
â†’ Type positive text + smile + speak calmly
â†’ Expected: Final emotion is fusion of all 3
â†’ Console: Shows all 3 detection types
```

## ðŸ“Š CONSOLE ANALYSIS

### "Capturing #N" Messages
```
[Facial Detection] Capturing #1: emotion (%)
  = Face-api.js analyzed a face
  
[Voice Analysis] Capturing #1: tone (Energy%, Pitch)
  = Web Audio API extracted voice features
  
[Text] #N: sentiment (%)
  = NLP keyword analysis completed
```

### "Emotion state updated"
```
Emotion state updated: EMOTION (%)
  = Dashboard should show this emotion
  = Happens every 2-3 seconds
  = Is the final fused emotion
```

### "Emotion data saved"
```
Emotion data saved and encrypted
  = Data successfully stored in IndexedDB
  = AES-256 encryption applied
  = Happens after every emotion fusion
```
